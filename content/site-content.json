        "It is a fast-paced construction technique that uses Aluminium Formwork to create strong and durable buildings and it is more economical than traditional construction methods because it requires less labour and time. It is also faster than traditional construction, more seismic resistance, smooth finishing of wall and slab, faster completion of floors, good quality of construction work with lesser joints and reduce leakages.",
        "The Formwork is the advanced system made of strong and sturdy Aluminium Components that has great strength, durability, simple to install, adaptable and is used in construction.",
        "Aluminium Formwork is majorly used in the places where the whole structures are made of concrete, the wall reinforcing steel is placed with the floor slab, prefabricated room-sized wall panels and floor slab panels are erected. The Aluminium alloy slabs are accurately made as per the required sizes. Spaces for windows, ducts, doors and other features such as staircases, façade panels are also integrated into these structures. After casting the forms,"
